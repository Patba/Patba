## 👋 Hi, I’m @Patba 👋 

- 🌠 I’m interested mostly in Astronomy, some electronic-synth music, and I do enjoy some VR Games!

- 📚 I study IT at Wyższa Szkoła Bankowa in Warsaw, Poland

- 🐍 I’m currently learning ***Python***, I have Django in my list, I do other stuff too, mostly I help out my fellow friends and I often attach some code from the tasks I did for them

- 📫 You can reach me through my mailbox: patbaau@gmail.com

- And if you have some free time, you can always listen to my music here -> https://open.spotify.com/artist/74APl3asUyULUr5f2Kzi7D?si=nE6QSTJ1Rnqa2JQjG-L9Dw
